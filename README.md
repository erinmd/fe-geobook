Discover hidden books around the world with our geocaching book app! Use GPS to find books in specific locations, read them, leave reviews, and connect with other book lovers. 

## Project Summary

This was a final group project for the Northcoders bootcamp. We worked in a team of 4 for 2 weeks, to create this app.
Team:
- https://github.com/erinmd
- https://github.com/beckybp
- https://github.com/rovercode1
- https://github.com/01gibbs

We used react native, expo, react-native-maps and firebase authentication for this project. We also created the backend which is hosted here: https://github.com/erinmd/geobook-be
using MongoDB, mongoose and express. 

Most of this technology was new to us, and we enjoyed the challenge of learning how to use it all!

The app allows users to:
- Signup/login
- Search for books on a map
- Claim books
- Replace claimed books
- Leave new books in new locations using a pin on a map
- View previously claimed books
